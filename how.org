#+TITLE: How

1. new directory
2. clone xmonad, xmonad-contrib
3. create package.yaml with library config for files under lib/ and executable config for xmonad.hs/Config.hs or whatever primary main/configuration file is
4. stack init
5. stack build
6. stack install :xmonad <-- install xmonad executable built from checked-out sources
7. build script to install and copy executable built from xmonad.hs (needed for xmonad --recompile to work)
